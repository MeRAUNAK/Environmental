            <p>As of May 2023, CO2 PPM (parts per million) is at 420.00 and the global temperature rise is 1.15C
                compared to pre-industrial levels. This is undoubtedly one of the biggest environmental problems of our
                lifetime: as greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the sun’s heat, leading to global
                warming.

                The last time carbon dioxide levels on our planet were as high as today was more than 4 million years
                ago. Increased emissions of greenhouse gases have led to a rapid and steady increase in global
                temperatures, which in turn is causing catastrophic events all over the world – from Australia and the
                US experiencing some of the most devastating bushfire seasons ever recorded, locusts swarming across
                parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, decimating crops, and a heatwave in Antarctica that saw
                temperatures rise above 20C for the first time. Scientists are constantly warning that the planet has
                crossed a series of tipping points that could have catastrophic consequences, such as advancing
                permafrost melt in Arctic regions, the Greenland ice sheet melting at an unprecedented rate,
                accelerating sixth mass extinction, and increasing deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, just to name
                a few.
                The climate crisis is causing tropical storms and other weather events such as hurricanes, heatwaves and
                flooding to be more intense and frequent than seen before. However, even if all greenhouse gas emissions
                were halted immediately, global temperatures would continue to rise in the coming years. That is why it
                is absolutely imperative that we start now to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, invest in
                renewable energy sources, and phase our fossil fuels as fast as possible.
